--Readme document for Nina Phan, nxphan@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment


2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
- At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute(s)
- Appropriate headings and paragraph text
- Links to external page(s)
- Semantic HTML tags like footer
- Custom Icons


(b) CSS features
- Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability
- Modifying link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing
- Leveraging Bootstrap CSS helpers (columns and rows)


(c) Advanced features
- Creating a more complex page layout: including a navigation bar that jumps to the desired section


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
I did not get any known problems in my html file, but I did get some potential warnings.
Many of the warnings stem from my more descriptive alt attribute of my imgs, choice of color, and inclusion of images.
The warnings suggest my alt text doesn't convey the same information as my images but I believe they provide more clarity and understanding.
I'm further warned that "Alt text is not empty and image may be decorative", but in the case the images don't load properly users are able to see what I intentionally put at that spot.
I purposefully used contrasting colors such as black and white to make focus and readability easier, so I'm unsure how my text/images may be "poor contrast".

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
About 10-12 hours.


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I did not consult with any classmates or individuals when completing this assignment.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
Make sure every image file is downloaded.
I did not flesh out a page for my specific projects so clicking the arrow to "view project" or "See More Projects" should simply take you to the home section.
The W3C validator link was kept on my page, and should appear on the very bottom right if needed for access.
